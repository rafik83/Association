Our work consisted in the development of backend application for membership management we call it Curiospress.
The goal of Curiospress is to provide people with a foundation to build user applications without all the hassle. Curiospress is cleanly written, well commented, formatted and documented, did I forget to mention its object oriented for easy customisation and developed using symfony2 ?
so this membership software provides you with everything you need to easily power a membership or subscription web businesscand completely automates account registration and events invitation, subscription management, automated invoicing, recurring billing, account management, reporting, newsletters, and much more. 
Curiospress supports unlimited themes and languages (arabic, englisj and french). Supports over 40 payment processors for full order and invoice automation.
